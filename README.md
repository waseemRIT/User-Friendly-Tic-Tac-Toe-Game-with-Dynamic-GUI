# User-Friendly Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Dynamic GUI
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using JavaFX, featuring a 3x3 grid, player turn status, and a reset button.

## Description
I developed a stunning implementation of the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe using the JavaFX library to create a modern, intuitive, and engaging graphical user interface (GUI). The program allows two players to play the game on a 3x3 grid and take turns marking the grid with either an 'X' or an 'O'. The GUI includes sleek and customizable buttons and icons that enhance the user experience.

One of the unique features of the program is the flexibility of the GUI. I designed it to be fully customizable, allowing users to personalize their gaming experience by choosing their preferred color scheme, font style, and button design. This feature not only adds to the game's visual appeal but also makes it more user-friendly and accessible.

Moreover, the program includes a dynamic reset button that clears the grid and starts a new game with just one click. This feature saves players the hassle of restarting the program, making the game more enjoyable and efficient.

Overall, the Tic-Tac-Toe project with a flexible GUI is an exciting, interactive, and functional program that demonstrates my proficiency in Java programming and GUI development. It's a testament to my attention to detail, creativity, and passion for developing innovative solutions that enhance the user experience.

## Usage
To run the program, you will need to have Java and JavaFX installed. You can then run the program by executing the game.java file.

The game can be controlled by clicking on the cells of the 3x3 grid. The program keeps track of the player's turn and displays it in the status bar. When a player gets three in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally a message will appear to notify the winner, the game will freeze and the players can click the reset button to restart the game.

## Note
This program was developed as a simple demonstration of the capabilities of JavaFX, the game logic could be improved and more features could be added, Feel free to customize it.
