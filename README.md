# Tic Tac Toe Game
A simple Tic Tac Toe game built using JavaFX, featuring a 3x3 grid, player turn status, and a reset button.

## Description
This program uses the JavaFX library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid and allows two players to take turns marking the grid with either an 'X' or an 'O'. The program also includes a reset button that allows players to clear the grid and start a new game.

## Usage
To run the program, you will need to have Java and JavaFX installed. You can then run the program by executing the game.java file.

The game can be controlled by clicking on the cells of the 3x3 grid. The program keeps track of the player's turn and displays it in the status bar. When a player gets three in a row either horizontally, vertically or diagonally a message will appear to notify the winner, the game will freeze and the players can click the reset button to restart the game.

## Note
This program was developed as a simple demonstration of the capabilities of JavaFX, the game logic could be improved and more features could be added, Feel free to customize it.
